- I am a Bachelor student in Artificial Intelligence at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/en/education/bachelors/artificial-intelligence), Nijmegen, Netherlands, with former education in Philosophy, Neuroscience, and Cognition, as well as Psychology. My academic interests are:
	- Steering towards a mechanistic understanding of neural networks.
	- Understanding of the cognitive mechanisms of controllability estimation.
	- The intersection of artificial and natural intelligence, i.e. can the field of AI learn from natural intelligence research and vice versa?
	- Novel brain imaging and modulation devices, such as fTUS. Generally, adaptive BCI applications!
- One of my previous projects revolved around the [Natural Abstractions Hypothesis](https://www.alignmentforum.org/tag/natural-abstraction#:~:text=The%20Natural%20Abstraction%20hypothesis%20says,dimensional%20than%20the%20system%20itself.) by [John Wentworth](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wentworthjohn/). I worked together with [Jan](https://universalprior.substack.com/) on understanding how the brain populates its cognitive maps with natural concepts (see [[Hebbian Natural Abstractions]]). I have also previous written about [[Artificial Sentience]], [[Ethics]] and [[Personal]] topics.
- Before diving into this area, I was actively involved in the climate movement, where I contributed as a UX designer and worked with organizations such as [Together for Future e.V.](https://togetherforfuture.org/) and [Future Matters Project](https://en.futuremattersproject.org/). In these roles, I focused on project management, team development, and knowledge management.
- When not immersed in the above things, I enjoy making music, bouldering, (long-distance) cycling and weight lifting. I sympathize with some views of the [Effective Altruism](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/) and [Rationality community](https://lesswrong.com/) (though I disagree on many parts as well; in general, I try to [keep my identity small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) and [form my own views](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8RcFQPiza2rvicNqw/minimal-trust-investigations)).
- If you’re interested in any of the aforementioned topics, the easiest method to contact me is via [Telegram](https://t.me/deroeko) (~1-3 days answering delay usually – but 100% response rate), otherwise you can use my [email](https://www.notion.so/Home-d61c32385b114627b19145dc3a008c15?pvs=21). [Here](https://fffutu.re/1-on-1s) you can also book a 1-on-1 with me or [give me anonymous feedback](https://fffutu.re/samfeedback) (I love reading feedback!). Also: I subscribe to [Crocker’s Rules](http://sl4.org/crocker.html), so feel free to optimize your message for information, rather than being nice (this does not imply reciprocity).
